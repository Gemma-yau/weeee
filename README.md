## About this game
**Connet the Dots** is a puzzle game requiring player to connect integers in ascending and descending orders alternatively.

Integers are randomly displaced around a square , player has to first connect them in ascending order,e.g. "1,2,3,4" , then in descending order, e.g. "1,2,3,4,3,2,1", and so on, until all the integers are being used.

Each integer is represented by a dot and each dot must be used once (and at most once). Consecutive intergers cannot be from the same side.
